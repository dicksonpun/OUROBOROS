# PANDA

Desktop GUI Demo based on C# and Material Design in XAML.

This C# application demonstrates a proof of concept regarding how UI elements are used and referenced.

The prototype demo consists primarily of GUI logic. 

The non-GUI logic consists of testing how to use C# syntax, learning WPF and databinding, and showcasing how to do asynchronous actions and general I/O for file manipulation.
